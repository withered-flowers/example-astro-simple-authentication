# Example Astro Authentication

## Description

For this example we will try to make a simple authentication based on client-side apps AND server-side apps.

Client Side:

- HTML & JS on Client, localStorage - (Astro) => Public and Protected
- Multiple Framework, nanostores - (React, Vue, and Svelte) => Public (React + Vue), Protected (Svelte)

Server Side:

- HTML & JS on Server, no JS on Client, cookies - (Astro) => Public and Protected
